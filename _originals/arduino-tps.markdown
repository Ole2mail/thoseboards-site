**Description:**
Arduino-TPS is a PMOD(™) interface compatible Arduino-UNO based module providing configurable signals routing between available PMOD(™) ports. easy configurable for UART/SPI/GPIO signal routing. fly-wire and bread-board replacement solution.

**Features:**
* CPLD based non-volatile signal routing configuration
* up to 5V signal IO pins tolerant
* embedded JTAG over FTDI programming interface
* standard VHDL/Verilog configurable signal routing
* Arduino UNO rails compatible pinout
* up to 18V unregulated DC input (meant for use with automotive 13.8V battery)
* up to 3A power injection into Arduino power rail (3V3 supply wire only)
* PMOD(™) compatible socket for modules connectivity
* FTDI based PMOD(™) compatible UART pinout
* extended support for UART signals including DTR/DSR/RI/DCD
