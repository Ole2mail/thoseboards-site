**Description:**
Arduino-Nucleo-DGX is a PMOD(™) interface compatible Nucleo based embedded development platform providing configurable signals routing between available PMOD(™) ports and STMicro IO signals. Easy configurable for UART/SPI/GPIO/I2C signal routing. Perfect fly-wire and breadboard prototyping replacement solution.

**Features:**
* CPLD based non-volatile signal routing configuration
* up to 5V signal IO pins tolerant
* embedded JTAG over FTDI programming interface
* standard VHDL/Verilog configurable signal routing
* Arduino UNO rails compatible pinout 
* STMicro Nucleo morpho rails compatible pinout
* up to 18V unregulated DC input (meant for use with automotive 13.8V battery)
* up to 3A power injection into Arduino power rail (3V3 supply wire only)
* 10 PMOD(™) compatible sockets for modules connectivity
* Complete I2C support including FT2232H
* extended support for UART signals including DTR/DSR/RI/DCD
* integrated RN-42 Roving Networks bluetooth chipset with optional MFI support
* Reset and management buttons step-up
* Headers pass-through stackable design
