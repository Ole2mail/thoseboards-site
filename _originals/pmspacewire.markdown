**Overview:**

pmSpaceWire is a spacecraft communication network module based in part on the IEEE 1355 standard. It combine a pair of high-speed differential Texas Instrument SN65 transmitter/receiver. The connection allows speeds between 2 Mbit/s and 400 Mbit/s. Two ports with a space-qualified 9-pin connectors and PMOD(TM) DUO on other side for CPLD/FPGA integration.

**Features:**

* SN65LVDS047PWR quad differential line driver
* SN65LVDS33PW four LVDS data line receiver
* independent ground connection screw-driver port
* 12 pins + 12 pins independent 2inOne design
* between 2 Mbit/s and 400 Mbit/s speed
* 2 Micro-D Female MDM-9SCBRP connector
