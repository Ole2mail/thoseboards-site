**Description:**
Beagle-DGX is a PMOD(™) interface compatible Beaglebone Black based embedded development platform providing configurable signals routing between available PMOD(™) ports and Cortex A8 IO signals. Easy configurable for UART/SPI/GPIO/I2C signal routing. Perfect fly-wire and breadboard prototyping replacement solution.

**Features:**
* Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA based PMOD interfaces configuration
* Xilinx CPLD based non-volatile board identity signal routing configuration
* up to 3V3 signal IO pins tolerant
* embedded JTAG over FTDI programming interface
* standard VHDL/Verilog configurable signal routing
* Beaglebone Black rails compatible pinout including 2x46 digital IO
* up to 18V unregulated DC input (meant for use with automotive 13.8V battery)
* up to 3A power injection into Beaglebone power rail (3V3 supply wire only)
* 6 PMOD(™) compatible sockets for modules connectivity
* Complete I2C support including FT2232H
* extended support for UART signals including DTR/DSR/RI/DCD
* Bootloader UART header step-up
* Reset and management buttons step-up
* Headers pass-through stackable design
