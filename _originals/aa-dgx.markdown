**Description:**

Arduino-Atlas-DGX is a PMOD(TM) interface compatible Intel Atlas/Quark based embedded development platform and Arduino-UNO. 

AA-DGX provides configurable signals routing between available PMOD(TM) ports and Intel IO signals. 

AA-DGX is easy configurable for UART/SPI/GPIO/I2C signal routing. Perfect fly-wire and breadboard prototyping replacement solution.

**Features:**

* CPLD based non-volatile signal routing configuration
* up to 5V signal IO pins tolerant
* embedded JTAG over FTDI programming interface
* standard VHDL/Verilog configurable signal routing
* Arduino UNO rails compatible pinout 
* Intel Atlas rails compatible pinout
* up to 18V unregulated DC input (meant for use with automotive 13.8V battery)
* up to 3A power injection into Arduino power rail (3V3 supply wire only)
* 4 PMOD(TM) compatible sockets for modules connectivity
* Complete I2C support including FT2232H
* extended support for UART signals including DTR/DSR/RI/DCD
* Reset and management buttons step-up
* Headers pass-through stackable design
