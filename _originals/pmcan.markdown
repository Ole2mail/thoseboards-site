**Overview:**
Simple and easy PHY (CAN) based port for industrial CANBUS, automotive AUTOSAR and marine NMEA2000 devices level L1 data exchange. It's an isolated controller area network physical layer transceiver with integrated linear regulator. The power is isolated between the supply, the logic side and a single power from the bus side. Uplink/Downlink upper layers could be implemented with the help of FPGA based CAN interface pcores.

**Features:**

* screwable ports for both CAN and POWER pairs
* 1Mbps capable PHY controller
* integrated miswire protection
* short circuit protection
* unpowered nodes do not disturb the bus
* 24v max bus acceptance
* 3.3v internal power based
* 12 pin PMOD(TM) interface connector
